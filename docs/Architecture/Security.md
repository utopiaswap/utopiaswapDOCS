# 🛡 Security

Security is a core pillar of UtopiaSwap. From smart contract design to deployment and user interaction, every part of the protocol has been carefully reviewed and tested to protect users and preserve trust.

---

## ✅ Internal Auditing Process

Every smart contract deployed by UtopiaSwap has undergone a **thorough internal audit** before mainnet deployment. This includes:

- Formal verification of logic
- Manual code review by multiple engineers
- Edge case analysis and stress tests
- Gas efficiency and reentrancy checks
- Simulated attacks and exploit testing

> 🔐 **No contract is deployed without passing our internal security checklist.**

Our internal audit process ensures that:
- User funds are never at risk of being locked or stolen
- Swaps are atomic and non-custodial
- Points tracking cannot be gamed or manipulated
- Protocol logic behaves deterministically across chains

## 🔒 Key Safety Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-custodial design     | UtopiaSwap does not hold or store user funds at any point                  |
| Atomic swaps             | All swaps succeed or revert — no partial execution                         |
| Controlled contract calls| Only whitelisted protocols and functions can be called through adapters     |
| Minimal on-chain logic   | Heavy logic (e.g., route scoring) is done off-chain to reduce surface area  |
| Event logging            | All user activity is tracked transparently via on-chain events              |

## 🧪 Test Coverage

All core smart contracts are:
- 100% covered by unit tests
- Continuously tested against simulated forks and edge cases
- Deployed to testnets before mainnet release

We also perform chain-specific regression testing before each deployment to account for network-specific quirks.

---

## 🛠 Bug Bounty (Coming Soon)

UtopiaSwap is planning to launch a **public bug bounty** program to reward community researchers who help identify and report potential vulnerabilities.

This program will:
- Offer tiered rewards based on severity
- Cover smart contracts, frontend interactions, and BRT logic
- Be managed via a trusted platform (e.g., Immunefi or HackenProof)

---

## 🧭 Security Philosophy

UtopiaSwap prioritizes:
- Simplicity over complexity
- Predictability over over-optimization
- Secure execution over cutting-edge experimentation

This lets us build confidently across multiple chains while maintaining safety, performance, and user trust.

> Security is never done. We are committed to continuous review, improvement, and transparency across every part of UtopiaSwap.
