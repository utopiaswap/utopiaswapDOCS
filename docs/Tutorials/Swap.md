# üèÅ Make Your First Swap

Making your first swap on **UtopiaSwap** is easy and takes just a few simple steps. Follow the guide below to start swapping tokens across chains in no time!

---

## üöÄ Steps to Swap

1. **Connect Your Wallet**  
   Head over to the [UtopiaSwap homepage](https://utopiaswap.net) and click the **Connect Wallet** button. You can use popular wallets like MetaMask or Brave wallet.

2. **Select Your Chain**  
   Once your wallet is connected, select the chain where you want to trade from the chain popup.  
   UtopiaSwap currently supports multiple chains including:
   - Ethereum (ETH)
   - Polygon (POLY)
   - Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
   - Optimism (OP)
   - Base
   - Celo

   Simply choose the chain you want to interact with.

3. **Choose Tokens and Amount**  
   - **Select the Token In**: Choose the token you want to swap from (e.g., USDC, ETH).
   - **Select the Token Out**: Choose the token you want to receive (e.g., DAI, WBTC).
   - **Enter the Amount**: Enter the amount of the token you want to swap. The system will automatically show you the estimated amount you'll receive in return.

4. **Swap and Confirm**  
   After selecting your tokens and amount, click the **Swap** button. UtopiaSwap will then fetch the best available rate from multiple liquidity sources.  
   You will be prompted by your wallet to confirm the transaction. Once confirmed, UtopiaSwap will execute the swap.

5. **Wait for Success Notification**  
   After the transaction is processed, you will receive a **Success** notification once your swap is complete. The token you swapped for will appear in your wallet shortly after.

## üïí Transaction Confirmation

UtopiaSwap operates in real-time, and depending on network congestion, your transaction might take a few moments to complete. Once your swap is confirmed on-chain, you‚Äôll see the tokens in your wallet.

If you‚Äôre using **MetaMask** or another wallet, be sure to check your wallet‚Äôs token list to see the swapped tokens.

## üöß Troubleshooting

- **Transaction stuck or failed?**  
   - Double-check if you have enough gas fees (ETH, BNB, etc.) on the selected chain.
   - If a swap failed, try again by selecting another token or chain.

- **Tokens not showing in wallet?**  
   - Ensure your wallet is set up to display the swapped tokens. If needed, manually add the token by pasting the token contract address.
