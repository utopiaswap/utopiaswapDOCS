# 🎁 UtopiaSwap Airdrop

UtopiaSwap rewards its early and active users through a fair and transparent **airdrop system**, based on real usage and contribution to the protocol.

If you’ve traded on UtopiaSwap, you may already be eligible to receive tokens.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Every time a user performs a swap on UtopiaSwap, the protocol tracks their activity by assigning **points** based on the **dollar value traded**.

These points accumulate **per chain**, and form the basis for airdrop eligibility.

> ✅ The more you trade, the more you earn.

---

## 🚨 First Allocation Already Done

The **first snapshot and allocation** has already taken place.

If your address qualified, you can **see your current $UTOPIA airdrop balance** displayed in the **top-right corner** of the UtopiaSwap interface (once your wallet is connected).

⏳ **Distribution of tokens is still TBD** — stay tuned for the official claim date.

## 🪙 Points System

| Action              | Points Earned                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Swap on any chain   | 1 point per $1 traded                     |
| Use multiple chains | Bonus multiplier                          |
| Early user          | Snapshot bonus (before public launch)     |

- Points are non-transferable and recorded per address
- All trades are counted
- Final snapshots for airdrops are taken periodically (every 3 days)

> 💵 **Currently, every $1 traded = 1 $UTOPIA allocation.** This rate may change for future reward waves.
